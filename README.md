## This Project, Soundwaves, is a tool that allows you to search for an artist and bring up an image that evokes the vibe of whatever it is you are listening!
-The image is not directly related to the artist, but it pulls Genre information from the artist and uses that information to search the Flickr and pull a random image that uses that tag, thus creating a visual experience that should pair nicely with that artist.
